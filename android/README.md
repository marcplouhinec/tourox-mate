# Tourox Mate - Android application

## Introduction
The goal of this Android application is to configure and control the physical device. It is more a "device tester" than
a real application for tour guides.

The Android device must have an OS version equal or greater than Android 4.3 (Jelly Bean), and must support
[BLE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bluetooth_Low_Energy).

## Build and installation
In order to build the Android application, please execute the following instructions:
* Download and setup [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio/index.html).
* Checkout this project on your computer, and open the `android` folder with Android Studio.
* Follow the Android Studio instructions to install the required SDKs and tools.
* Plug your Android device to the computer with USB debugging enabled.
* Run the application by clicking on the *Run* toolbar button.

Please read the "usage" section of the [parent document](../README.md) for more information about how to use Tourox Mate.
